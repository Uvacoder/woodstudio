A cute brush based on an [Aspen Golan](https://www.aspengolann.com/) design, made as a gift for my hairdresser wife after returning to work from a long pandemic-forced vacation. This bush features black dyed maple veneers sandiwched between birdseye maple segments, glued togehter and shaped into a nice little tool for keeping stations tidy.
