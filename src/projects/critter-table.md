A weird little six-legged side table with a shaped top and turned legs. Finished with hard wax and black milk paint. I started this piece during [Pat Kim's](https://www.patkimdesign.com/) fantastic sculptural furniture class at [Anderson Ranch Arts Center](https://www.andersonranch.org/). While I explored several forms, I kept coming back to these pillowy, hot dog bun shapes with a bold, graphical plan view. I don't often build furniture this conceptual, but it was a fun opportunity to stretch and experiment.
