Midcentury coffee table in walnut and glass for Edward and Christine. This kinda turned into my
COVID escape project, resulting in a lot of care and details: turned and staked legs, patchwork
inlays, shop made veneer, dovetailed drawers, round recessed finger pulls, wooden drawer slides,
and the ability to replace the glass if anyone decides to drop elbows off the top turnbuckle.
