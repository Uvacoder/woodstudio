This large, live edge dining table is made from several slabs of black walnut from my home state of West Virginia. The top is buttressed by a custom, intersecting metal base that's a modern take on hairpin legs&mdash;producing interesting shapes when viewed from different angles. The accompanying Tolex chairs have been capped with matching walnut seats to make everything feel like a cohesive piece.
