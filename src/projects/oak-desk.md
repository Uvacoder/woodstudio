This desk was a fun collab with my brother, an architect in the Bay Area. He found the stainless steel base on Craigslist, and we developed a design of riftsawn oak laminated with several layers of baltic birch plywood for the tabletop. To lighten the profile and accentuate the plywood grain, we profiled the edges with rounded corners and a heavy underbeve.
