            About Justin
          </Text>
          <P>
            I am a designer and furniture maker based out of San Francisco, CA.
            This site is a collection of my work.
          </P>
          <P>
            I grew up as a farm kid in West Virginia, helping my family build
            fences, buildings, and houses. I got my start in woodworking in
            2012, when I was on the hunt for a mid-century credenza for our
            first home in Durham, NC. At the time I didn't understand why a
            rectangle of wood costs $3,000, but a friend and a skilled named
            artist Elijah Leed was willing to show me the ropes so I could build
            it myself. I've been obsessed ever since.
          </P>
          <P>
            My work focuses on unexpected forms grounded in a modern
            scandanivian vernacular. I offer design services, millwork
            fabrication, and lovingly crafted, functional pieces of furniture
            made by hand under the worried oversight of my shop dog Pixie.
          </P>
          <P>
            When not making furniture at my small home shop in the Castro or at
            Hunt Projects in the Bayview, I am a full-time designer and manager
            at Google in SF. Please get in touch if there's anything we could
            realize together.
          </P>
